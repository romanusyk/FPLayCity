# FPLayCity
Fantasy Premier League stats & predictions

## Start here

```bash
./refresh.sh              # fetch FPL + FotMob, then project both games
./run.sh -m src.web.serve   # review app on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The review app is the front door. It serves a draft board ranked by value over replacement, an
FPL board ranked by points and price, a per-player breakdown of where every projected point
comes from, and a comparison view for two runs of the same game. Every column explains itself on
hover, and `#/glossary` collects those explanations on one page.

These docs cover the rest:

- **`src/fpl/projection/README.md`** — how a projection is produced and what each component model
  does. Read this before changing a model.
- **`src/web/README.md`** — the app, its routes and its screens.
- **`docs/prediction_roadmap.md`** — where FPL points actually come from, measured, and what is
  still worth building.
- **`docs/glossary.md`** — the vocabulary: the game's terms, and ours (`p(start)`, VORP,
  replacement level, Δnext, tiers, runs and methods).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — repo conventions and the traps that have already cost time.

The long architecture discussion below predates all of that and describes the older in-season
pipeline (`src/fpl/forecast/`, `src/fpl/compute/`), which still exists and still works. Phase 3
of the north star — a FastAPI layer — has now landed as `src/web/`, though for the review app
rather than as a general API over the compute pipeline.

## System Overview

### Data Types

**Raw Data** (cached JSON from FPL API):
- `bootstrap-static/`: Teams, players, gameweek info
- `fixtures/`: All fixtures with scores, difficulty ratings
- `element-summary/{id}/`: Individual player history and upcoming fixtures

**Core Models** (immutable data structures):
- `Team`: FPL team with strength ratings (attack/defense, home/away)
- `Fixture`: Match with home/away teams, scores, gameweek, outcome
- `Player`: FPL player with position, team, cost
- `PlayerFixture`: Player performance in a fixture (points, minutes, xG, xA, CS, DC)
- `News`: News article with metadata, tags, gameweek assignment, and collection source

**Statistics** (aggregated metrics):
- `Aggregate`: Total/count pairs for calculating averages
- `StatsAggregate`: Metrics broken down by FDR (1-5) and side (home/away)
- `TeamStats` / `PlayerStats`: Historical statistics with form metrics (last N games)

**Predictions** (model outputs):
- `FixturePrediction`: Team-level predictions (clean sheets, xG, xA)
- `PlayerFixturePrediction`: Player-level predictions with actual vs predicted comparison

### Design Patterns

**Indexed Collections** (in-memory database):
- Generic `Collection` class with multiple indices for O(1) lookups
- Example: `Fixtures.get_one(fixture_id=42)` or `Fixtures.get_list(gameweek=5)`
- Pattern: Avoid linear searches by pre-building indices on key fields

**Progressive Replay** (time-series simulation):
- `Season.play(fixtures)` replays gameweeks sequentially
- Builds historical statistics incrementally
- Enables backtesting: predict GW N using only data from GW 1 to N-1

**Aggregate Pattern** (statistics computation):
- All metrics stored as `Aggregate(total, count)` 
- Supports weighted averaging: `wa()` and square-root weighted: `swa()`
- Normalized values: `fdr_norm` scales predictions by difficulty

**Model Hierarchy** (composable predictions):
- Base classes: `FixtureModel`, `PlayerFixtureModel`
- Variants: Season avg, form-based, FDR-based, composite
- Composition: `PlayerPointsSimpleModel` combines CS/xG/xA/DC models

### Data Flow

```
FPL API → load.py → JSON cache → bootstrap() → Collections (Teams/Fixtures/Players/News)
                                                      ↓
                                        Season.play(fixtures) → Statistics
                                                      ↓
                                        Models.predict() → Predictions
                                                      ↓
                                        Evaluation → Points comparison
```

### Key Innovations

1. **Indexed Collections**: O(1) lookups without database overhead
2. **Timestamped Snapshots**: All API responses timestamped for reproducibility (single latest snapshot per resource)
3. **Progressive Replay**: Simulate season to build realistic statistics
4. **FDR Normalization**: Scale predictions by fixture difficulty
5. **Component-Based Points**: CS + xG + xA + DC → total points

## Architecture Analysis

### What Works Well

✅ **Indexed Collections**: O(1) lookups are fast and elegant
✅ **Progressive Replay**: Backtesting is realistic and prevents data leakage
✅ **Immutable Data**: Core models are stable and don't change unexpectedly
✅ **Timestamped Snapshots**: Reproducibility is built-in with single-snapshot storage

### Current Pain Points

**1. Boilerplate for Experimentation**
```python
# To try a new model, need 10+ lines:
cs_model = UltimateCleanSheetModel(season)
xg_model = SimpleXGModel(season)
xa_model = SimpleXAModel(season)
dc_model = SimpleDCModel(season)
player_cs_model = PlayerCSSimpleModel(season, cs_model, min_history_gws)
player_xg_model = PlayerXGSimpleModel(season, xg_model, min_history_gws)
# ... repeat for each experiment
```

**2. Repetitive Prediction Generation**
```python
# Lines 112-116 and 125-137 are nearly identical
for pf in PlayerFixtures.get_list(fixture_id=fixture.fixture_id):
    gw_predictions.add_player_cs_prediction(PlayerFixtureCsPrediction(player_cs_model.predict(pf)))
    gw_predictions.add_player_xg_prediction(PlayerFixtureXgPrediction(player_xg_model.predict(pf)))
    # ... 4 lines of similar code
```

**3. Hard to Access Data Interactively**
- Global collections (Teams, Fixtures, Players) are singletons but scattered
- Season state is passed through deep hierarchies
- No easy way to query "show me top 10 players for GW 20"
- Can't easily tweak parameters and re-run

**4. Script-Based, Not Interactive**
- main.py runs full evaluation loop (30+ gameweeks)
- Hard to inspect intermediate results
- No REPL-friendly workflow for exploration

### Improvement Principles: Stateless On-Demand Computation

**Core Philosophy:** Define operations as composable functions, not materialized state. Compute only when results are requested.

#### Principles

**1. Laziness Over Eagerness**
- Don't precompute and store predictions for all players
- Define HOW to compute, not WHAT is computed
- Let consumers request exactly what they need

**2. Pure Functions Over State**
- Predictions are pure functions: `f(immutable_data, parameters) → result`
- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- No hidden state, no cache invalidation, no staleness

**3. Composition Over Inheritance**
- Small, focused functions that combine naturally
- Filter → Map → Reduce pipelines
- Example: `filter(by_position) | map(predict) | sort(by_points) | take(n)`

**4. Parameters as First-Class Citizens**
- Position, gameweek, top-N are query parameters, not object state
- Change parameter → get new result, instantly
- No need to mutate state and remember to recalculate

#### Implementation: Query-Oriented API

```python
# query_engine.py - Pure functions for on-demand computation

class Query:
    """Stateless query functions - compute on demand from immutable data"""
    
    # --- Data Access (Pure Lookups) ---

# Usage in debugger/REPL:

...     'xg': SimpleXGModel(season),
...     'xa': SimpleXAModel(season),
...     'dc': SimpleDCModel(season),
... }

# Quick queries (all parameters explicit, compute on demand)
>>> Query.top_players(season, models, gameweek=20, n=5, position=PlayerType.MID)
>>> Query.top_players(season, models, gameweek=20, n=5, position=PlayerType.FWD)

# Compare across gameweeks
>>> Query.compare_gameweeks(season, models, "Salah", range(20, 25))

# Value picks
>>> Query.best_value(season, models, gameweek=20, position=PlayerType.MID)

# Compose queries (chain operations)
>>> top_mids = Query.top_players(season, models, 20, position=PlayerType.MID, n=20)
>>> expensive_mids = [p for p in top_mids if p.player.now_cost > 10.0]
>>> sorted(expensive_mids, key=lambda p: p.xg_points)[:5]
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No precomputed state to invalidate
- ✅ All parameters explicit (no hidden state like `season.pos`)
- ✅ Easy to compose (filter, map, sort, reduce)
- ✅ Perfect for debugger: change parameter, call function, see new result
- ✅ Memory efficient: compute only what's requested
- ⚠️ Trade-off: Recomputes on every call (acceptable for interactive use)

### Recommended Approach

**Embrace stateless computation with Query API:**

1. **Refactor `Query` class** with pure, composable functions
   - Move prediction logic into stateless functions
   - Make all parameters explicit (no hidden state)
   - Support chaining and composition

2. **Add helper for season replay**
   ```python
   def setup_season(up_to_gw: int) -> Season:
       season = Season()
       for gw in range(1, up_to_gw):
           season.play(Fixtures.get_list(gameweek=gw))
       return season
   ```

3. **Use in debugger workflow**
   - Set breakpoint after season setup
   - Call `Query.top_players()` with different parameters
   - Compose queries as needed
   - No state to invalidate, no stale data possible

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Minimal refactoring (extract functions, no complex infrastructure)
- ✅ Works perfectly with PyCharm debugger
- ✅ Stateless = no cache invalidation complexity
- ✅ Composable = flexible experimentation
- ✅ Pure functions = easy to test and reason about

## North Star: Unified Model-View Architecture

### Vision

Build a unified architecture where **data models**, **API schemas**, **UI representations**, and **debugger views** all derive from a single source of truth: **Pydantic models + view layer**.

### Migration Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Models → Pydantic
```python
# Before (stdlib dataclass)
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Player:
    player_id: int
    web_name: str
    team_id: int

# After (Pydantic BaseModel)
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

class Player(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    
    player_id: int
    web_name: str
    team_id: int
    
    # Computed fields stay as @property or migrate to @computed_field
    @property
    def team(self) -> Team:
        return Query.team(self.team_id)
```

**Impact**: 
- Change instantiation from positional to keyword args
- Add runtime validation
- Enable JSON Schema generation

#### Phase 2: View Layer
```python
# Define view models for different contexts
class PlayerSummaryView(BaseModel):
    """Quick view for logs/debugger"""
    name: str
    team: str
    cost: str

class PlayerMcpView(BaseModel):
    """Complete view for MCP tools"""
    player_id: int
    web_name: str
    team_id: int
    team_name: str
    position: str
    now_cost: float
    
class PlayerPredictionView(BaseModel):
    """View for prediction results"""
    player_id: int
    web_name: str
    team_name: str
    predicted_points: float
    cs_points: float
    xg_points: float
    xa_points: float

# Converter functions
def to_summary(p: Player) -> PlayerSummaryView:
    return PlayerSummaryView(
        name=p.web_name,
        team=Query.team(p.team_id).name,
        cost=f"£{p.now_cost}m"
    )

def to_mcp_view(p: Player) -> PlayerMcpView:
    return PlayerMcpView(
        player_id=p.player_id,
        web_name=p.web_name,
        team_id=p.team_id,
        team_name=Query.team(p.team_id).name,
        position=p.player_type.name,
        now_cost=p.now_cost
    )

def to_prediction_view(p: Player, pred: PlayerTotalPrediction) -> PlayerPredictionView:
    return PlayerPredictionView(
        player_id=p.player_id,
        web_name=p.web_name,
        team_name=Query.team(p.team_id).name,
        predicted_points=pred.total_points,
        cs_points=pred.cs_points,
        xg_points=pred.xg_points,
        xa_points=pred.xa_points
    )
```

#### Phase 3: HTTP API + MCP Integration
```python
# api.py - HTTP API with FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class GetPlayerRequest(BaseModel):
    player_id: int

@app.post("/player")
def get_player(req: GetPlayerRequest) -> PlayerMcpView:
    """Get player details"""
    player = Query.player(req.player_id)
    return to_mcp_view(player)

@app.post("/predict")
def predict_player(req: GetPlayerRequest) -> PlayerPredictionView:
    """Get player predictions"""
    player = Query.player(req.player_id)
    # ... run prediction ...
    return to_prediction_view(player, prediction)

# Generate OpenAPI spec
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import json
    openapi_spec = app.openapi()
    with open("openapi.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(openapi_spec, f)
```

```python
# mcp_server.py - MCP server via HTTP proxy
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Option 1: Direct definition with view models
mcp = FastMCP("FPL Predictions")

@mcp.tool()
def get_player(player_id: int) -> PlayerMcpView:
    """Get detailed player information"""
    player = Query.player(player_id)
    return to_mcp_view(player)

# Option 2: Auto-generate from HTTP API
mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    spec="http://localhost:8000/openapi.json",
    base_url="http://localhost:8000"
)
# All tools auto-generated with proper schemas!
```

#### Phase 4: Unified Representations
```python
# Core model uses views for __repr__
class Player(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)
    
    player_id: int
    web_name: str
    team_id: int
    now_cost: float
    
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        """PyCharm debugger shows clean representation"""
        view = to_summary(self)
        return f"{view.name} ({view.team}, {view.cost})"
    
    def to_dict(self, view: str = "summary") -> dict:
        """Flexible serialization for any context"""
        if view == "summary":
            return to_summary(self).model_dump()
        elif view == "mcp":
            return to_mcp_view(self).model_dump()
        elif view == "full":
            return self.model_dump()
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown view: {view}")
```

### Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - Core models define data structure
   - Views define presentations
   - No duplication or drift

2. **Type Safety Everywhere**
   - Pydantic validates at runtime
   - Type hints checked by IDE
   - API contracts enforced

3. **Automatic API Generation**
   - Pydantic → JSON Schema → OpenAPI
   - FastMCP generates tools from OpenAPI
   - HTTP API and MCP stay in sync

4. **Flexible Representations**
   - Multiple views per model
   - Context-appropriate formatting
   - Debugger, logs, APIs all use same view layer

5. **Maintainability**
   - Change model → views update
   - Add field → API schema updates
   - Refactor converter → all consumers benefit

### Implementation Strategy

**Start Small, Iterate:**

1. ✅ **Completed**: Query facade for data access
2. 🔄 **Next**: Migrate 1-2 core models to Pydantic BaseModel
3. 🔄 **Then**: Create 2-3 view models for different contexts
4. 🔄 **Then**: Build HTTP API for subset of features
5. 🔄 **Finally**: Generate MCP server from OpenAPI

**Success Criteria:**
- Core models are Pydantic BaseModel
- 3+ view types per core model (summary, detail, MCP)
- HTTP API serves predictions with Pydantic views
- MCP server auto-generated from OpenAPI spec
- `__repr__` uses view layer for clean debugger output

## Where to improve predictions

See "Improving predictions" — a measured breakdown of where FPL points come from and a
prioritised roadmap — at `docs/prediction_roadmap.md`.

The loop for actually doing it: change a model in `src/fpl/projection/`, add a named method to
`METHODS` that differs from `v1-baseline` in exactly one way, generate a run, and open the
Compare screen. See "Adding a method" in `src/fpl/projection/README.md`.

## Seasons

The active season is declared once, in `Season.CURRENT` (`src/fpl/loader/utils.py`). Rolling
over to a new season is a one-line change there plus a `SEASON_TEAMS` entry in
`src/fotmob/models/fotmob_metadata.py` for promotion/relegation.

Two things make cross-season work subtle, and both are handled centrally:

- **Identifiers move.** FPL reassigns element `id` and team `id` every season — 16 of 20 team
  ids changed meaning between 2025/26 and 2026/27. Element `code` and team `short_name` are the
  only stable keys, and all cross-season joins use them.
- **A new season starts empty.** Until GW1, `bootstrap-static` still carries last season's
  totals against each player's *new* club. `./run.sh -m src.fpl.fetch --baseline` captures them
  into `PlayerSeasons` so models have something to work with on day one. Bootstrap is
  unreliable for players who changed club, so `element-summary/history_past` is treated as
  authoritative — see `src/fpl/loader/baseline.py`.

## Usage

Load data from FPL API:
```bash
./run.sh -m src.fpl.fetch                  # refresh the current season's snapshots
./run.sh -m src.fpl.fetch --baseline       # also capture last season's per-player totals
./run.sh -m src.fpl.fetch --baseline-only  # capture only the baseline
```

Capture FotMob lineups, including pre-season friendlies:
```bash
./run.sh -m src.fotmob.load                      # every club in the current season
./run.sh -m src.fotmob.load --team 'Coventry'    # a single club
./run.sh -m src.fotmob.load --season 2025-2026   # backfill an earlier season
```

Fetch news articles:
```bash
./run.sh -m src.fpl.loader.news.pl fpl_scout --last-gw=15
./run.sh -m src.fpl.loader.news.pl fpl_scout --last-gw=15 --first-gw=14
./run.sh -m src.fpl.loader.news.pl fpl_scout --last-gw=15 --list-known-content
```

Generate a projection run, then review it:
```bash
./run.sh -m src.fpl.project                        # both games, default method
./run.sh -m src.fpl.project --game draft           # one game only
./run.sh -m src.fpl.project --method v0-raw-dc     # a control, for comparison
./run.sh -m src.fpl.project --list-methods
./run.sh -m src.web.serve                          # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Or chain fetch, FotMob capture and projection in one step:
```bash
./refresh.sh                    # default method
./refresh.sh v0-no-preseason    # a named method
SKIP_FETCH=1 ./refresh.sh       # reproject from what is already on disk
```

Run in-season predictions & evaluation (needs played gameweeks):
```bash
./run.sh -m src.fpl.main
```

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
./run.sh -m pytest
```

Run with verbose output:
```bash
./run.sh -m pytest -v
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
./run.sh -m pytest tests/test_immutable.py
```

Run specific test class or method:
```bash
./run.sh -m pytest tests/test_immutable.py::TestQueryFacade::test_query_player_by_name
```

Offline tests (no network, no cached data required):
```bash
./run.sh -m pytest tests/test_prior_season.py tests/test_fotmob_friendlies.py \
              tests/test_projection_models.py tests/test_artifacts.py
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Scoring: all 23,165 stored 2025/26 player-matches re-scored and reconciled exactly
- ✅ Collections: Teams, Fixtures, Players, PlayerSeasons, PlayerFixtures, Gameweeks, News
- ✅ Prior-season reconciliation: bootstrap vs `history_past`, club-change repairs, loud failures
- ✅ Friendlies: match-kind classification, weighted squad roles, per-season club rosters
- ✅ Projection models: defensive-contribution shrinkage, replacement level, tiers, methods
- ✅ Artifacts: run immutability, retention, feedback, draft state — all in a temp directory
- ✅ HTTP: every app route against the real snapshots, read-only
- ✅ Query facade: All lookup methods (including news queries)
- ✅ Data integrity: Relationships and computed properties
- ⚠️ Unsupported indices: Tests verify they raise `KeyError`

Details, including which tests need cached data and which do not — `tests/README.md`.
