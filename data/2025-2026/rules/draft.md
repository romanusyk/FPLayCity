# FPL Draft Rules

##### Game Entry

Before drafting your FPL Draft squad you'll need to name your team and join a league. There are three options available:

1. Create a new private league and invite friends to play.
2. Join a private league with a code you've been sent.
3. Join a public league and play against 3, 5 or 7 randomly assigned players.

With your Premier League account you can enter up to 10 private and 3 public leagues. You'll need to draft a new squad for each league though.

##### Leagues

Leagues have one of two types of scoring:

- Classic: Teams are ranked based on the total fantasy points awarded to the team.
- Head-to-Head: Each Gameweek teams play a match against another team in the league, with the winner being the player whose team scored more fantasy points. 3 points will be awarded for a win and 1 point for a draw. These points are used to determine league ranking.

Private league administrators can choose a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 16 team entries for a league although an ideal maximum would be 8 in order to ensure a good distribution of top ranked players and for the draft to not go on for too long. Public leagues have 4, 6 or 8 teams.

If a head-to-head league has an uneven number of entries, then an average team will be added. This team will not have any players in, but will score an average Gameweek score based on the scores in that individual league.

League administrators can now renew their league and its members from the previous season via the Start tab.

When a league is renewed, administrators have the option to use the reverse standings from the previous season as the draft order for the initial draft of the new season. (See Draft Order for more details.)

Once renewed, all players from the previous season are automatically reinstated to the league. If required, league administrators can manually remove players from the renewed league. It is recommended that renewal is coordinated with member registration.

The private league administrator will select a date for the draft to take place. Anyone joining the league will need to do so prior to the draft deadline. Users joining a league should also allow time to choose their draft preferences prior to the deadline. If the draft runs past the next Gameweek deadline, then the league will simply start the following Gameweek. Public league drafts will take place around 15 minutes after the first team joins the league.

New for the 2025/26 season, league administrators can now schedule up to three additional drafts during the season, following the initial draft. This feature is ideal for refreshing squads —particularly during the January transfer window — and allows league members to adapt to player arrivals and other changes.

Redrafts are set up through the same League Admin page used for the initial draft. Administrators can choose the Gameweek, date, and time for each redraft.

Redrafts can be scheduled at any point before or during the season but must be scheduled before the prior Gameweek. For example, if a redraft is planned for Gameweek 19, it must be scheduled prior to Gameweek 18 or earlier. Also, in this example, once the deadline for Gameweek 17 has passed, that redraft cannot be edited or changed.

When a league administrator selects a Gameweek for a redraft, they are choosing the Gameweek in which the draft will take place, specifically before the rollover deadline of that Gameweek.

For example:
If you select Gameweek 1, the draft will occur during preseason, before Gameweek 1 begins.
If you select Gameweek 17, the draft will be scheduled during Gameweek 16, prior to the Gameweek 17 deadline on Saturday 20th December at 13:30.

Once the game enters the Gameweek immediately before the selected one, the draft time becomes locked.

Using above as the example, if you selected Gameweek 17 for your redraft, you can only edit and reschedule the draft while in Gameweek 15 or earlier.

Once Gameweek 16 begins, the draft is considered imminent, and its timing can no longer be changed.

Another new feature for 2025/26 allows league administrators to use league standings as the basis for the draft order.

For renewed leagues, the draft order for the initial draft can be set using the reverse standings from the previous season.

For redrafts, the draft order can be set using the current standings (in reverse order) from the relevant Gameweek.

If new teams have joined a renewed league, they will be placed at the bottom of the initial draft order in a random order.

If the minimum number has not been met at the time of the draft, the draft date will be pushed back 24 hours. This will continue until the minimum number has been met. Should this time move beyond the first deadline, the game will start properly at the next deadline (assuming that the draft is completed).

After a league has been pushed back 3 times it will be deleted. This counter can be reset by making a change to the league (eg. draft time).

If a draft is not completed before rollover, the draft will be updated to be in the Gameweek the game is rolling over to. If there is a draft that already exists there and is a clash, the later draft will be removed as you cannot have two drafts in a single Gameweek.

When a Gameweek Deadline Time changes – either moving to an earlier or later date - drafts may need to be realigned to preserve the schedule and avoid conflicts.

If the Gameweek Deadline Time moves forward (to an earlier date)

And a draft…
Is currently assigned to a later Gameweek
Has a draft time that is before the updated Deadline Time of the updated draft Gameweek
Has not been completed
Then
The draft should be moved to the updated Gameweek, unless doing so would cause a duplicate draft.
If a draft already exists for the same league and the updated Gameweek, the conflicting draft (always the later one) will be deleted instead of reassigned.

If a Gameweek Deadline Time moves out (to a later date)

And a draft...
Is currently assigned to the updated Gameweek
Has a Draft Deadline Time that is after or equal to the updated Deadline Time, but still before the deadline of the next Gameweek
Has not been completed
Then
The draft should be moved forward to the next Gameweek and if there is a clash, the latest draft will be deleted.

The private league administrator may delete a league before scoring starts. Players are able to leave a league up until the draft starts.

##### The Draft

You will draft a squad of 15 players in the following positions:

- 2 Goalkeepers
- 5 Defenders
- 5 Midfielders
- 3 Forwards

Each Premier League player can only be in one manager's squad in your league.

Before the draft takes place you are able to create a priority watchlist of players. This list can help quickly identify potential picks during the draft and will also be used to automatically draft a player if you aren't available to participate.

The draft will automatically start at the designated time if the minimum number of teams has been met. A random order will be generated which will "snake" from round to round during the 15 rounds of the draft. In a snake draft the pick order is reversed each round, for example:

- Round 1: Team A, Team B, Team C, Team D
- Round 2: Team D, Team C, Team B, Team A
- Round 3: Team A, Team B, Team C, Team D
- Round 4: Team D, Team C, Team B, Team A
- etc...

Depending on private league settings, you will be given between 30 and 120 seconds (default 90) to pick a player for your squad. If you fail to pick a player within the time limit then the following criteria will be used to make an automatic pick:

1. Select the highest priority player from your watchlist who is both available and in a position you still require.
2. Select the highest ranked available player in the draft list in a position you still require.

If an automatic pick is made then you will be marked as being offline and picks will be automatically made in subsequent rounds. You can mark yourself online again in the draft room to resume manual drafting.

Player added to the game less than 24 hours before the scheduled draft start time will not be available. There will be an opportunity to select them in the first waiver process after the draft, see the Transactions section for more details on waivers.

##### Transactions (Unsigned players)

After the draft has completed you will still be able to bring unsigned players into your squad using transactions. Depending on the state of the game these transactions will either be waiver requests (which may or may not be successful) or free agency signings.

Typically transactions will be in the form of waiver requests, with free agency only active in the 24 hours before each gameweek deadline for last minute changes.

The waivers process ensures that everyone gets a fair chance to add unselected players to their squad. When making a waiver request your are proposing to replace a player in your squad with an unselected player from the same position.

Waiver requests are usually processed 24 hours before the gameweek deadline though this will be reduced if there is a small timespan between the last game finishing and the next gameweek starting.

Any number of waiver requests can be made, if you make more than one they will need to be prioritised.

The lowest ranked team will get first waiver choice. Before the season starts the waiver order will be the reverse of the draft order. Once a waiver request is successful, the team in question will move to the end of the waiver queue for that gameweek.

If more than one team are tied on points, their position in the league table will be determined randomly. As a result, the lowest positioned team will get the higher waiver order.

Free agency works like traditional Fantasy Premier League transfers. Any available player can be added to your squad by swapping them for a player from the same position in your squad.

Players can be in one of the following states:

- Owned - player is already in a squad
- Available - player is available to be selected either immediately (if free agency is active) or at the next waiver process
- Locked - player can't be selected. Reasons for this are a) player has been added to the game within 24 hours of the waiver / draft deadline or when free agency mode is active or b) player has been removed from another squad. Locked players become available for waiver requests at the next deadline.

1. Once the draft is finished all unselected players will be available for selection via waivers. An exception is if the league draft completes less than 48 hours before the next deadline, in this case all unselected players who aren't locked will be immediately available via free agency.
2. Waivers are processed 24 hours before the Gameweek deadline.
3. After waivers are processed, free agency mode will be active until the Gameweek deadline.
4. Once the gameweek deadline passes all players are available on waivers. Steps 2-4 now repeat.

##### Transactions (Player trades)

After the draft has completed, depending on how your league has been configured, you can trade players with other managers in your league. Your league will have one of the following settings:

- No trades - No trading is allowed.
- All trades - Trading is allowed, accepted trades will be instantly processed.
- Administrator approval - Trading is allowed, accepted trades can be vetoed by the league administrator.
- Manager approval - Trading is allowed, accepted trades can be vetoed by other managers in the league. If 50% of managers object to the trade then it won't take place.

When trades are subject to approval, approval will be assumed if not given by the waiver deadline.

Trade settings can only be changed before the draft starts.

Trade offers can be made each Gameweek until the waiver deadline. If trades in your league require approval, then the trade deadline will be 24 hours before the waiver deadline.

A trade offer involves proposing to swap one or more players in your squad with the same number of players from another squad in your league. Trades can involve multiple positions but must be like for like. For example, you may offer to trade 1 Midfielder and 2 Forwards for 1 Midfielder and 2 Forwards but not 2 Midfielders and 1 Forward.

Trade offers may be withdrawn at anytime until they are accepted by the other manager.

You may propose the same player in multiple trade offers. Once a trade is accepted any other trades involving players in the accepted trade will be invalidated.

If a trade hasn't been accepted by the waiver deadline (or 24 hours before if approval rules apply) then it will expire.

Trade offers must be accepted by the waiver deadline. If trades in your league require approval the trade deadline will be 24 hours before the waiver deadline.

Once a trade offer has been accepted it can't be cancelled.

Trades in leagues which don't require approval will be processed instantly.

Trades which require approval will be processed as soon as they satisfy the required criteria. At the waiver deadline trades which haven't been explicitly objected to will assume to have been approved. Trades will be processed before waiver requests.

Trades which do not meet the required approval criteria will be flagged as vetoed as soon as the rejection criteria is met.

A trade can be in one of the following states:

- Proposed - Offer has been made.
- Withdrawn - Proposed trade withdrawn by the instigator.
- Rejected - Proposed trade rejected by the recipient.
- Accepted - The trade has been accepted but requires approval.
- Invalid - A player involved in the proposed trade has been part of another accepted trade.
- Vetoed - The trade was accepted but has been vetoed by the league administrator or managers.
- Expired - The proposed trade wasn't accepted by the trade deadline.
- Processed - The trade has been made.

##### Managing your squad

Once the draft has completed you will be able to manage your squad on the My Team page.

From your 15 player squad, select 11 players by the Gameweek deadline to form your team.

All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players, however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically substituted.

Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.

There are no captains in fantasy draft.

Your substitutes provide cover for unforeseen events like injuries and postponements by automatically replacing starting players who don"t play in a Gameweek.

For the purpose of automatic substitutions playing in a Gameweek means playing at least 1 minute or receiving a yellow / red card.

Based on the priorities you assign, automatic substitutions are processed at the end of the Gameweek as follows:

- If your Goalkeeper doesn't play in the Gameweek, he will be substituted by your replacement Goalkeeper, if he played in the Gameweek.
- If any of your outfield players don't play in the Gameweek, they will be substituted by the highest priority outfield substitute who played in the Gameweek and doesn't break the formation rules (eg. If your starting team has 3 defenders, a defender can only be replaced by another defender).

##### Deadlines

All changes to your team (starting 11, free agent signings, substitiution priorities) must be made by the Gameweek deadline in order to take effect for that set of matches.

Deadlines are subject to change and will be 90 minutes before the kick-off time in the first match of the Gameweek.

The deadline to submit waiver requests will usually be 24 hours before the listed Gameweek deadline though this will be reduced if there is a small timespan between the last game finishing and the next gameweek starting.

##### Scoring

Scoring is identical to the Fantasy Premier League game and works as follows.

During the season, your fantasy football players will be allocated points based on their performance in the Premier League.

The addition of Defensive Contribution points helps reward outfield players who may not earn a goal or an assist but still make significant contributions during a match.

Any defender who reaches an accumulative total of 10 or more clearances, blocks, interceptions (CBI) and tackles in a single match will earn 2 points.

Any midfielder or forward who reaches an accumulative total of 12 or more clearances, blocked shots, interceptions (CBI), tackles and recoveries will earn 2 points.

A clean sheet is awarded for not conceding a goal whilst on the pitch and playing at least 60 minutes (excluding stoppage time)

If a player has been substituted when a goal is conceded this will not affect any clean sheet bonus.

If a player receives a red card, they will continue to be penalised for goals conceded by their team.

Red card deductions include any points deducted for yellow cards

Assists are awarded to the player from the goal scoring team who has the final touch before a goal is scored.
The final touch can be a pass, an inadvertent touch, or a shot.

When a deflected pass is received inside the penalty area, an assist will be awarded if the recipient is the goalscorer. When a deflected pass is received outside the penalty area, an assist will be only awarded if the intended target of the pass is the goalscorer.

No assist will be awarded if the pass receives two or more defensive touches or if the defensive touch is a pass.

No assist will be awarded if the goalscorer loses and regains possession before the goal is scored.

For an inadvertent touch to count as an assist, it must lead directly to the goal scoring opportunity.

If a goal is scored directly following a save, block or a shot rebounding off the woodwork, an assist is awarded. The shot does not have to be on target to result in an assist. The action leading to the save, block or rebound can be a shot or a cross-shot but not an obvious cross or pass attempt.

Deflections on a shot before the save, block or rebound do not cancel out the assist if the shot was and remains on target. No assist will be awarded when a player scores from a second attempt after their initial shot is blocked, saved or hits the woodwork.

Own Goals

A player who has the final touch before an own goal is scored is awarded an assist. The final touch can be a pass, an inadvertent touch, or a shot.

If an own goal is scored following a deflected pass, an assist is awarded. No assist will be awarded if the pass receives two or more defensive touches or if the defensive touch is a pass.

If an own goal is scored directly following a save, block or a shot rebounding off the woodwork, an assist is awarded.

Penalties and Free-Kicks

In the event of a penalty or direct free-kick being scored, the player earning the penalty or free-kick is awarded an assist.

If a pass or touch deflects off an opponent before a handball, then no assist is awarded. If a shot deflects off an opponent before a handball, an assist will be awarded provided the shot remains on target.

No assist will be awarded if the goal is scored by the player who earned the penalty or free-kick.

See “NEW” for more information on the changes to assists.

Finalising Assists

Assist points awarded by Stats Perform within Fantasy Premier League are calculated using additional stats which may differ from other websites. For example, some other sites would not show an assist where a player has won a penalty.

For the avoidance of doubt, points awarded in-game are subject to change up until one hour after the final whistle of the last match of the Gameweek. Once the points have all been updated on that day, no further adjustments to points will be made unless under extraordinary circumstances.

The final decision on Fantasy assists is made by Fantasy Premier League in consultation with Stats Perform.

The Bonus Points System (BPS) utilises a range of statistics to create a BPS score for every player. The three best performing players in each match will be awarded bonus points. 3 points will be awarded to the highest scoring player, 2 to the second best and 1 to the third.

Here are just some examples of how bonus point ties will be resolved are as follows:

- If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 & 2 will receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.
- If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3 points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.
- If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3 points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 & 4 will receive 1 point each.

Players score BPS points based on the following statistics (one point for each unless otherwise stated):

Data is supplied by Stats Perform and will not be changed after the last day of the Gameweek has been marked as final. We will not enter into discussion around any of the statistics used to calculate this score for any individual match.
