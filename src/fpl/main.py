"""
Main execution script for FPL predictions using lazy computation pipeline.

Process:
1. Bootstrap data from FPL API
2. Create lazy computation pipeline
3. Generate predictions for target gameweek(s) with automatic caching
4. Evaluate performance:
   - Compare model predictions vs form-based and cost-based selection
   - Report total points across evaluation period

Key features:
- Lazy evaluation: Only compute what's needed
- Automatic caching: Reuse results for same parameters
- Type-safe computation graph

Run with: uv run -m src.fpl.main
