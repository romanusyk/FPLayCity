# Update README Files Along Path

When making changes to any `.py` file, check whether any README.md files along the path hierarchy need to be updated.

## Rule

**When modifying a Python file at path `path/to/file.py`:**
1. Check for README.md files at each directory level along the path:
   - `README.md` (project root)
   - `path/README.md`
   - `path/to/README.md`
   - (and so on, up to but not including the file itself)

2. For each README.md that exists:
   - Read the README content
   - Analyze the changes made to the Python file
   - Determine if the README needs updates based on:
     - New functions, classes, or modules added
     - Changed function signatures or behavior
     - Removed functionality
     - New dependencies or imports
     - Changes to public API or key concepts
   - Update the README if documentation is outdated or missing

3. Follow the documentation standards in `docs/metadoc.md`:
   - Use top-down structure
   - Keep documentation concise
   - Maintain consistency with existing style
   - Link to related documentation appropriately

## Examples

**Example 1:** Modifying `src/fpl/test.py`
- Check and update (if needed):
  - `README.md` (root)
  - `src/README.md` (if exists)
  - `src/fpl/README.md` (if exists)

**Example 2:** Modifying `src/fpl/loader/news/pl.py`
- Check and update (if needed):
  - `README.md` (root)
  - `src/README.md` (if exists)
  - `src/fpl/README.md` (if exists)
  - `src/fpl/loader/README.md` (if exists)
  - `src/fpl/loader/news/README.md` (if exists)

## When to Update

Update README files when:
- ✅ Adding new public functions, classes, or modules
- ✅ Changing function signatures or behavior that affects usage
- ✅ Removing functionality documented in the README
- ✅ Adding new dependencies or imports that users should know about
- ✅ Changing key concepts, data structures, or design patterns
- ✅ Modifying public API endpoints or entry points

Do NOT update README files for:
- ❌ Internal refactoring that doesn't change public API
- ❌ Bug fixes that don't affect documented behavior
- ❌ Code style changes
- ❌ Comments-only changes

## Implementation

When editing a Python file:
1. After making changes, identify all README.md files along the path
2. For each README.md:
   - Read the current content
   - Compare with the changes made to the Python file
   - Determine if updates are needed
   - If updates are needed, propose and apply them

## Notes

- Only check README.md files that actually exist (don't create new ones unless explicitly requested)
- Follow the existing documentation style and structure
- Reference `docs/metadoc.md` for documentation standards
- Keep updates focused and relevant to the changes made
